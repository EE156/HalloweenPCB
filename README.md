## EE156 PCB Project

This is based on the the Snowflake project by @maholli [here](https://github.com/maholli/snowflake).

If you wish to add a touch sensitive sensor, read the Adafruit tutorial [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-12-key-capacitive-touch-sensor-breakout-tutorial/overview)

If you would like, CastlePCBOutline.svg is a board outline that is more interesting than a rectangle.

You will need to figure out how to turn this into a DXF file and import it into the appropriate layer in KiCad.
